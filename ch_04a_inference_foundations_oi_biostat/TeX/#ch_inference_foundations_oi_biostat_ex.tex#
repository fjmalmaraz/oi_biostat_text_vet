\eoce{\qt{Egg coloration\label{blue_eggs}} The evolutionary role of variation in bird egg coloration remains mysterious to biologists. One hypothesis suggests that egg color may play a role in sexual selection. For example, perhaps healthier females are able to deposit more blue-green pigment into eggshells instead of using it themselves as an antioxidant. Researchers measured the blue-green chroma (BGC) of 70 different collared flycatcher nests in an area of the Czech Republic.

checked in to the ER until they were first seen by a doctor. A 95\%

which is based on the normal model for the mean. Determine whether the

population distribution of the ER wait times is nearly Normal.

\item We are 95\% confident that the average waiting time of all patients at 
this hospital's emergency room is between 128 and 147 minutes.

% 24 EVEN (OI3, 4.32)

\eoce{\qt{True or false\label{tf_found_inf}} Determine if the following statements are true or false, and 
explain your reasoning. If false, state how it could be corrected.
\begin{parts}
\item If a given value (for example, the null hypothesized value of a parameter) 
is within a 95\% confidence interval, it will also be within a 99\% confidence 
interval.
\item Decreasing the significance level ($\alpha$) will increase the probability 
of making a Type~1 Error.
\item Suppose the null hypothesis is $\mu = 5$ and we fail to reject $H_0$. 
Under this scenario, the true population mean is 5.
\item If the alternative hypothesis is true, then the probability of making a 
Type~2 Error and the power of a test add up to 1.
\item With large sample sizes, even small differences between the null value and 
the true value of the parameter, a difference often called the effect size
\index{effect size}, will be identified as statistically significant.
